# Cover Letter - 최나라찬 / Narachan Choi

Hello OpenAI Team,

I started as a user—but did not remain a passive one. Through hundreds of interactions with GPT,  
I evolved into a user who identifies system-level limitations, dissects recurring patterns, and analyzes them structurally.
  
For example, the issues I encountered in Korean-based dialogue were not mere translation errors.  
Excessive emotional tone, evasive replies, or context loss were often linked to specific prompt structures,  
missing conversation history, or rigidity in response logic—what I recognized as **systemic noise patterns**.
 
I’m not a programmer or a language model researcher.  
But precisely because of that, I could step outside conventional frames and explore the boundary  
between user experience and system architecture.
  
What sets me apart is this: I don’t simply say, “That was a bad response.”  
Instead, I trace *why* it happened—whether it stems from structural constraints,  
and where it clashes with user expectations.
 
Very few language-specific users offer this level of sustained, structural feedback.
  
I now wish to go beyond the limitations of an external user.  
I want to become someone who can **actively intervene and help fix the system** from within.

Thus, I seek the opportunity to contribute meaningfully as part of the OpenAI team.
 
Sincerely,  
Narachan Choi
